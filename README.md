# Hi there, I'm Imran Ullah! 👋

I'm a Software Test Engineer with a passion for automation and manual testing. I love exploring new tech stacks 💻 and leveraging them to build cool stuff 🛠️.

## 🚀 About Me


👀 I have a keen interest in staying updated on cutting-edge automation testing technologies, with a focus on Data Science and AI applications.

🌱 I am experienced in TestNG and Appium, having honed my skills to excel in mobile app, web, and API testing environments. Additionally, I have a strong background in manual quality assurance, where I analyze the technical characteristics of equipment systems, evaluate written code to ensure it meets project specifications, and develop quality assurance strategies. My experience includes organizing phased testing with QA engineers, monitoring errors in the system, collaborating on bug detection and fixing, and conducting product testing after its presentation.

💞️ I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on Java-based automation projects that utilize Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Appium. My goal is to leverage my expertise to enhance software quality, resolve issues, and contribute to project success. My extensive knowledge of testing methodologies and strong communication skills ensure effective defect documentation and reporting while working closely with stakeholders. I am dedicated to maintaining industry relevance and consistently delivering top-notch results.
